SNHU- Computational Graphics and Visualization

Course focused on creating realistic, interactive three-dimensional objects through the use of application programming interface (API) libraries and best practices. Using OpenGL, this course progressed in complexity culminating with fully formed graphic applications to meet project requirements. The due-out for this course was recreating a student-picked scene with numerous different shapes in OpenGL. The progressions of this project went from manipulating objects, adding colors, textures, lighting, and tying everything together to gain a thorough understanding of the course objectives.
